# To-Do
### This is less than a tracker for me, and more for you to see what needs to be implemented.

## IMPORTANT
- [ ] Remove readline and use prompt instead - causing duplicate characters on an input

## General
- [X] Segregate files into different OS's
- [X] OS Detection

## Linux Support
- [ ] Remove readline and use prompt instead
- [ ] Add support for other distros

## Windows Support
- [ ] Remove readline and use prompt instead
- [ ] Add support for Windows full-stop
- [ ] When installing SSL, manually import certificate into Nginx configuration
- [ ] Use of NGINX's "include" function to use .conf files, rather than directly editing the main .conf file. [See this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23413380/8826843)
- [ ] Restart Nginx function needs to be adjusted
- [ ] TESTING!

## MacOS Support
### I don't even know if NGINX is supported on MacOS, but I'm sure it is.
